## Hyper-Activation of Hippocampal Newborn Neurons Results in Abnormal Neurogenesis and Epileptogenesis in Mouse Model

Here is the abstract of my current research project: "Epilepsy is a devastating neurological condition, affecting around 50 million people world-wide. However, The pathophysiology of epilepsy is not completely understood. Previous studies have reported that the abnormal neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus contributes to the development of epilepsy. Neurogenesis is defined as the formation of new neurons from neural stem cells. Abnormal neurogenesis can follow brain injury, infection, or status epilepticus (SE). It is characterized by altered morphology, ectopic migration, altered dendrites, mossy fiber sprouting, and accelerated maturation This process generates hyperexcitable cells and a subsequent breakdown of the dentate gyrus gates, allowing for unregulated activity in recurrent seizures. Epileptogenesis is the process of changes occurring in the brain during the latent period after a triggering injury or illness, resulting in the development of spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS). New models of epilepsy are now being created using Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs), which are engineered muscarinic receptors that allow for the inhibition or excitation of targeted neurons by exogenous ligands. The aim of this research is to determine the specific timepoints of aberrant neurogenesis and abnormal epileptiform activity following dentate granule cells specific activation post injection of Clozapine-N-Oxide. We hypothesize that using ASCL1-CreER-Ai3 (RCL-EYFP)/hM3Dq transgenic mice, chemogenetic activation of hippocampal newborn dentate granular cells will lead to abnormal neurogenesis, and the hyper-activation of hippocampal newborn neurons will lead to epileptogenesis." 

I have had the opportunity to present this research at the 2023 Summer Student Symposium at Lerner Research Institute and Case Western's Fall 2023 Intersections Symposium!
