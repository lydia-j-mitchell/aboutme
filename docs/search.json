My focus includes studying the role of newborn neurons in the development of temporal lobe epilepsy post pilocarpine injections in mouse models. My responsibilities include sectioning, staining, & mounting mouse brain tissue samples for imaging, capturing images of the hippocampus using specialized microscopes, counting the quantity of newborn neurons in the hilar area of the hippocampus, running qPCR samples to check the validity of RNA primers used in mouse models, conducting pilocarpine experiments in mice, performing perfusions to collect whole brain tissue samples, administering injections into mouse models, utilizing MatLab to run spike detection software to analyze the number of seizure spikes from raw EEG data, manually analyzing raw EEG data of experimental and control groups in mouse models for seizure activity, and performed immunohistochemistry on brain tissue samples."

My focus was studying the function of various transcription in the nucleolus of yeast strains. My responsibilities included growing & analyzing various strains of yeast, using a microscope to compare different transcription factors within the nucleolus, capturing images to compare the prevalence of transcription factors, Ordering RNA primers for different strains of yeast, running PCR experiments to test the validity of primers."

    "text": "Here is the abstract of my current research project: “Epilepsy is a devastating neurological condition, affecting around 50 million people world-wide. However, The pathophysiology of epilepsy is not completely understood. Previous studies have reported that the abnormal neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus contributes to the development of epilepsy. Neurogenesis is defined as the formation of new neurons from neural stem cells. Abnormal neurogenesis can follow brain injury, infection, or status epilepticus (SE). It is characterized by altered morphology, ectopic migration, altered dendrites, mossy fiber sprouting, and accelerated maturation This process generates hyperexcitable cells and a subsequent breakdown of the dentate gyrus gates, allowing for unregulated activity in recurrent seizures. Epileptogenesis is the process of changes occurring in the brain during the latent period after a triggering injury or illness, resulting in the development of spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS). New models of epilepsy are now being created using Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs), which are engineered muscarinic receptors that allow for the inhibition or excitation of targeted neurons by exogenous ligands. The aim of this research is to determine the specific timepoints of aberrant neurogenesis and abnormal epileptiform activity following dentate granule cells specific activation post injection of Clozapine-N-Oxide. We hypothesize that using ASCL1-CreER-Ai3 (RCL-EYFP)/hM3Dq transgenic mice, chemogenetic activation of hippocampal newborn dentate granular cells will lead to abnormal neurogenesis, and the hyper-activation of hippocampal newborn neurons will lead to epileptogenesis.”\nI have had the opportunity to present this research at the 2023 Summer Student Symposium at Lerner Research Institute and Case Western’s Fall 2023 Intersections Symposium!"

I am a 4th-year neuroscience major and 1st-year BS/MS in Biostatistics student at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio. I’m from Washington, DC, where I’ve lived for all of my life!\nAs a neuroscience student, my research interests surround numerous neuroscience topics including neurogenesis, epilepsy, and Alzheimer’s. I am an undergraduate research student at the Suh Lab at Cleveland Clinic’s Lerner Research Institute. My current research involves studying the involvement of abnormal neurogenesis in the development of epilepsy in mouse models.\nIn addition to being a student, I am also involved in my campus community! I am member of the Delta Gamma sorority where I have held numerous leadership roles including being in charge of our philanthropy, Service for Sight! I am also a member of the premier Greek life leadership fraternity, Order of Omega. I am also a member of an organization called S.M.A.R.R.T. which stands for Students Meeting About Risk and Responsibility Training! Through this organization, we present to the Greek life chapters on campus on important issues such consent, substance use, and self-care!\nOn this website, you will find a selection describing my current research, experience, and current my C.V.!
